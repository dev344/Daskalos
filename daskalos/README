*involvong the user and showing how to do things.This application is python based.
* Our motto is "Tell me and I will surely forget, Show
				me and I may remember, Involve me and I will learn"

Dependencies :
--------------
- dogtail-0.7.0 or later
- xnee-3.06 or later

Python bindings for your distribution, e.g. python-apt or rpm-python

PyGTK and GNOME-Python

Using :
-------
Currently only GNOME and GTK+ applications are supported since dogtail 
supports only these. KDE 4 should have the accessibility support that
will enable you to use dogtail with it.

First, make sure accessibility support is enabled in your GNOME session with:
  gconftool-2 --type bool --set /desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility true
You may want to log out and log back in again so that i works properly.

Important
---------
Make sure no adminstrative window is open like synaptic package manager, 
software sources, network settings while running daskalos.
