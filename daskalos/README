* Daskalos is an interactive help application which uses dogtail and xnee for 
*involvong the user and showing how to do things.This application is python based.
* Our motto is "Tell me and I will surely forget, Show
				me and I may remember, Involve me and I will learn"

Dependencies :
--------------
- dogtail-0.7.0 or later
- xnee-3.06 or later

Python bindings for your distribution, e.g. python-apt or rpm-python

PyGTK and GNOME-Python

Usage :
-------
Currently only GNOME and GTK+ applications are supported since dogtail 
supports only these. KDE 4 should have the accessibility support that
will enable you to use dogtail with it.

First, make sure accessibility support is enabled in your GNOME session with:
  gconftool-2 --type bool --set /desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility true
You may want to log out and log back in again so that i works properly.

Important
---------
Make sure no adminstrative window is open like synaptic package manager, 
software sources, network settings while running daskalos.


How to write tutorials
-----------------------
The structure of the tutorial can be understood by going through any of the 
tutorial codes.To write a tutorial of your own you can use the help of an 
application called 'Accerciser'.You can also use dogtail-recorder alongwith 
it.With the help of these two applications and the module observer in daskalos
folder you can start writing a tutorial in no time :)
