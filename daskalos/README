License : GPL


Dependencies :
--------------
- dogtail-0.7.0 or later
- xnee-3.06 or later

Python bindings for your distribution, e.g. python-apt or rpm-python

PyGTK and GNOME-Python

Usage :
-------
Currently only GNOME and GTK+ applications are supported since dogtail 
supports only these. KDE 4 should have the accessibility support that
will enable you to use dogtail with it.

First, make sure accessibility support is enabled in your GNOME session with:
  gconftool-2 --type bool --set /desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility true
You may want to log out and log back in again so that i works properly.

Important
---------
Make sure no adminstrative window is open like synaptic package manager, 
and software sources while running daskalos.


How to write tutorials
-----------------------
The structure of the tutorial can be understood by going through any of the 
tutorial codes.To write a tutorial of your own you can use the help of an 
application called 'Accerciser'.You can also use dogtail-recorder along with 
it.With the help of these two applications and the module observer in daskalos
folder you can start writing a tutorial in no time :)

You can also make use of xnee if needed to make the tutorials.It might come
of real use in some cases.

   Limitations for the tutorials:
    For these tutorials if the list in the menu grows too long then some of the
    menu items cannot be chosen.But since this is aimed to be used only by 
    beginners in linux I assumed that they would not have many items in the 
    menu.
