To try out daskalos u need to install
dogtail-0.7 or above     which is available in my git repo
xnee-3.06 or above 
and the assistive technology as to be enabled.

Then you can either use the deb file to install daskalos
or if you downloaded the daskalos folder then you just run
daskalos.py from that folder.
